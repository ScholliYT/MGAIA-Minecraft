NOTE: This file is an old example script. Although it is no longer
      comprehensive, and it does not use the most modern features or best
      practices of GDPC, it still contains a good amount of information while
      performing a practical task.

      New users are advised to look at the scripts in tutorials/ first, and
      then come back here for a slightly outdated, but practical application.

Generate an emerald city.

This file contains a collection of functions designed
to introduce new coders to the GDMC HTTP client in Python.

The source code of this module contains examples for:
- How to structure a file neatly (search 'STRUCTURE')
- Requesting the build area (search 'BUILDAREA')
- Introduction to world slices (search 'WORLDSLICE')
- Introduction to basic heightmaps (search 'HEIGHTMAP')
- Introduction to basic geometric shapes (search 'geo')

NOTE: We recommend creating your own files instead of modifying or adding code
      to these pre-existing files.

NOTE: If part of the program is running to fast for you to understand, insert
      >>> from time import sleep
      and
      >>> sleep(0.1)
      at the appropriate locations for a delay of 1/10 of a second
      Alternatively, inserting
      >>> input("Waiting for user to press [Enter]")
      will pause the program at that point.

NOTE: This file will only be updated in the case of breaking changes
      and will not showcase new features!

NOTE: Should you have any questions regarding this software, feel free to visit

# === STRUCTURE #1
# These are the modules (libraries) we will use in this code
# We are giving these modules shorter, but distinct, names for convenience

# Here, we set up Python's logging system.
# GDPC sometimes logs some errors that it cannot otherwise handle.
logging.basicConfig(format=colored("%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s", color="yellow"))


# === STRUCTURE #2
# These variables are global and can be read from anywhere in the code.
# NOTE: If you want to change a global value inside one of your functions,
#       you'll have to add a line of code. For an example, search 'GLOBAL'.

# Here we construct an Editor object

# Here we read start and end coordinates of our build area

# Using the start and end coordinates we are generating a world slice
# It contains all manner of information, including heightmaps and biomes
# For further information on what information it contains, see
# https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Chunk_format
#
# IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that a wold slice is a 'snapshot' of the world,
# and any changes you make later on will not be reflected in the world slice
