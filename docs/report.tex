\section{Introduction}

% Discuss WFC on block level which consumes too much memory on 100x100x100

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Building Placement}

% Buffer around building region (improvement: make buffer require blocky of smaller (not equal) height)

% Scanner fails to handle water and starts building on sea level or above water
% Same problem with ice blocks

% Implement as integeger linear optimization problem. But current performance is usable.


\subsection{Building Structure Building Blocks}
% Structure scanning
% Structure building / placement (translations, roatations)

\subsection{Buildings}

\subsection{Wave function collapse}
% Symmetry checker

% Retry insteack of backtracking

% Air structures

% Air around building to enforce closed form

\subsection{Interior Design}
